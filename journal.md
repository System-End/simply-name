FINALLY GETTING STARTED!!!

Started looking at items
[Adafruit magtag](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4800)
weeks on end battery
magnets to clip on
only a few seconds to update
4 colors

[LilyGO T-Display](https://www.amazon.com/LILYGO-T-Display-Arduino-Development-CH9102F/dp/B099MPFJ9M)
cheaper by abt $10
needs to be charged more often - ~8hrs
full color

need a battery
[maybe a 420mAh LiPo Battery will work](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4236)

want to get something like the 
[MPU6050 6-Axis Accelerometer/Gyro Module](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3886) so i can have a sleep and wake mechanism when i walk.

also going to solder a [BME280 Module](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2652) so i can also display accurate humidity and tempature.

deicided to add vibrations for when it is low on abttery and makes a succesful update or loses/gains connection. [Coin Vibration Motor (10mm diameter)](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1201)

[wifi 2.4ghz](https://www.adafruit.com/product/944) so that i can have a better range

[power switch](https://www.adafruit.com/product/805) or [power switch vertical](https://www.adafruit.com/product/3220)

[PN2222 NPN Transistor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/756) for motor controls

[diode](https://www.adafruit.com/product/755) for motor protection

[resistors](https://www.adafruit.com/product/4294)

[jumper wires female to female](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1951)
[jumper wires male to female](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1954)
[heat shrink](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1649)

[breadboard for testing](https://www.adafruit.com/product/64)

[22-26 wire guage](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1311)
